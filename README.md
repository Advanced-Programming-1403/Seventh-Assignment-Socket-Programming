## Important Note:
When you're opening this project on your own system, please make sure to:

1. Go to **Settings/Preferences** > **Build, Execution, Deployment** > **Build Tools** > **Gradle**.

2. Under **Gradle settings**, change the **Gradle distribution** to:

- **Use local Gradle distribution**, and

- Set the **Gradle home** path to your own local Gradle installation directory.

If you don’t have Gradle installed locally, you can either:

- Install Gradle manually and configure the path, or

- Change the setting to **Use Gradle wrapper** instead.



## Introduction
Welcome to the Seventh Advanced Programming (AP) Assignment. This project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Theoretical Questions**: This section is designed to deepen your understanding of advanced multithreading concepts in Java. You'll have to analyze one code block and answer questions about it.

2. **Practical Questions**: In this section, you'll get hands-on experience with multithreading in Java. Your code will be manually checked to ensure you've implemented the tasks using multithreading.


## Objectives 🎯

## Evaluation 📊

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated based on:

- **Understanding of Multithreading Concepts**: Your ability to accurately answer the theoretical questions, and demonstrating a deep understanding of multithreading in Java. Remember that the answers to the theoretical questions should be provided separately in a markdown file.

- **Code Quality**: Your code should be well-structured, readable, and efficient. Proper use of Java conventions, including variable naming, class structure, and comments, will also be considered.

- Don’t forget to answer the question in the Monte Carlo task within the report file.

- Your Banking System code must pass all the provided tests.

- Total: 100 points
    - 🧠 Theoretical Questions – 20 points
    - 🧮 Practical Task 1 (Chat) – 50 points
    - 🏦 Practical Task 2 (File Upload Download) – 30 points
    - 🌟 Bonus Tasks – Up to 10 extra points

## Submission ⌛
