## Important Note:
When you're opening this project on your own system, please make sure to:

1. Go to **Settings/Preferences** > **Build, Execution, Deployment** > **Build Tools** > **Gradle**.

2. Under **Gradle settings**, change the **Gradle distribution** to:

- **Use local Gradle distribution**, and

- Set the **Gradle home** path to your own local Gradle installation directory.

If you don‚Äôt have Gradle installed locally, you can either:

- Install Gradle manually and configure the path, or

- Change the setting to **Use Gradle wrapper** instead.



## Introduction
Welcome to the Seventh Advanced Programming (AP) Assignment. This project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Theoretical Questions**: This section is designed to deepen your understanding of advanced multithreading concepts in Java. You'll have to analyze one code block and answer questions about it.

2. **Practical Questions**: In this section, you'll get hands-on experience with multithreading in Java. Your code will be manually checked to ensure you've implemented the tasks using multithreading.

## Theoretical Questions üìù
**Note: Please answer these questions in a Markdown file (Report.md) and place it in the root directory of your fork. Include code or screenshots where you see fit.**

### 1. Three Ways to Send a Login Message

```java  
  class LoginRequest implements Serializable {
    String username;
    String password;

    LoginRequest(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }
}
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 5050);

        LoginRequest loginRequest = new LoginRequest("user1", "pass123");
        // === Method 1: Plain String ===
        PrintWriter stringOut = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
        stringOut.println("LOGIN|" + loginRequest.username + "|" + loginRequest.password);

        // === Method 2: Serialized Object ===
        ObjectOutputStream objectOut = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
        objectOut.writeObject(loginRequest);

        // === Method 3: JSON ===
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        String json = gson.toJson(loginRequest);
        PrintWriter jsonOut = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
        jsonOut.println(json);

        socket.close();
    }
}
```  

### **Questions:**
####  Method 1: **Plain String Format**

1. What are the pros and cons of using a plain string like `"LOGIN|user|pass"`?
2. How would you parse it, and what happens if the delimiter appears in the data?
3. Is this approach suitable for more complex or nested data?

---
#### Method 2:  **Serialized Java Object**

1. What‚Äôs the advantage of sending a full Java object?
2. Could this work with a non-Java client like Python?

---
#### Method 3: **JSON**

1. Why is JSON often preferred for communication between different systems?
2. Would this format work with servers or clients written in other languages?

## Practical Questions üíª

### üßÆ Chat

#### üìù Task Description
---
In this task, you will complete the functionality for a basic command-line chat application. The application allows multiple users to join a shared chat room, send messages to each other, and receive messages in real time. Your work involves both the client-side and server-side logic needed to support live message exchange and communication flow.


#### üõ† What You Need to Do
---
- Implement the logic for reading and processing incoming messages on the server side.
- Handle message sending from the server to an individual client.
- Broadcast messages from one user to all others and update the chat history.
- Ensure that the server updates its list of connected clients properly when a client disconnects.
- On the client side, implement the functionality to listen for and display new messages from the server.
- Start the client-side message receiver when a user enters the chat.
- Enable sending a message from the client to the server when the user types in the chat.
- Implement the exit mechanism so that when a user types `/exit`, the client disconnects cleanly from the server.

## Evaluation üìä

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated based on:

- **Understanding of Multithreading Concepts**: Your ability to accurately answer the theoretical questions, and demonstrating a deep understanding of multithreading in Java. Remember that the answers to the theoretical questions should be provided separately in a markdown file.

- **Code Quality**: Your code should be well-structured, readable, and efficient. Proper use of Java conventions, including variable naming, class structure, and comments, will also be considered.

- Don‚Äôt forget to answer the question in the Monte Carlo task within the report file.

- Your Banking System code must pass all the provided tests.

- Total: 100 points
    - üß† Theoretical Questions ‚Äì 20 points
    - üßÆ Practical Task 1 (Chat) ‚Äì 40 points
    - üè¶ Practical Task 2 (File Upload Download) ‚Äì 40 points
    - üåü Bonus Tasks ‚Äì Up to 10 extra points

## Submission ‚åõ

1. Add your mentor as a contributor to the project.
2. Create a `develop` branch for implementing features.
3. Use Git for regular code commits.
4. Push your code and the answers file to the remote repository.
